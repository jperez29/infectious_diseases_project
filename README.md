# Research Goal:
The purpose of this project was to analyze disease outbreaks in the US from 1998 to 2015. I strived to answer the following questions:

1. Are foodborne disease outbreaks increasing or decreasing? 
2. What microorganism species has been responsible for the most illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths? 
3. What location for food preparation poses the greatest risk of foodborne illness?
4. What year saw the most foodborne disease outbreaks?
5. What food items caused a high number of illnesses?

### What are infectious Diseases?

Infectious diseases are diseases caused by pathogenic microorganisms - such as parasites, viruses, or bacteria.

They can be spread, indirectly or directly (vector-borne), from animals to humans, and from person to another.

When the immune system of a host is fully functional, disease symptoms may not develop whenever an infectious organism attacks it. But, if the host immune system is compromised, or the infectious organism overwhelms the immune system, an infectious disease may take over the host's immune system. 

The discovery of antibiotics has helped slow down the spread of infectious diseases, but the misused and overused of them are creating antibiotic-resistant bacteria. It is critical to keep track of infectious diseases as they are a major public health problem.

Foodborn diseases are caused by consuming contaminated foods or beverages. Understanding the patterns of infectous disease outbreaks can help to prepare for and most importantly, prevent future outbreaks. It can provide knowledge to health officials about the people most at risk for certain types of diseases, the food/produce that tend to be contaminated often, and overall information to help control outbreaks.
